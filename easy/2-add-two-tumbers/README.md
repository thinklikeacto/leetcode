Here, we initialize a dummy head node dummy to hold the sum and a current node current to the dummy head. We also initialize the carry to 0. We then iterate over the two linked lists l1 and l2 until at least one is empty. We get the value of the current node in each linked list or 0 if it's empty, calculate the sum of the two values and the carry from the previous digit, update the carry for the next iteration, and create a new node with the least significant digit of the sum. We then move to the next node in each linked list or None if at the end, and move to the next node in the sum linked list. If there's still a carry left over after adding all the digits, we create a new node for it. Finally, we return the next node after the dummy head, which holds the sum.


**What is the input format for the "Add Two Numbers" problem?** <br />
The input consists of two non-empty linked lists of integers. Each linked list is represented by a series of nodes, where each node contains a single digit and a pointer to the next node. The digits are in reverse order, so the ones digit is at the head of the list.


**What is the output format for the "Add Two Numbers" problem?** <br />
The output is a linked list representing the sum of the two input linked lists. The digits in the output are also in reverse order, so the ones digit is at the head of the list.


**What is the time complexity of the solution?** <br />
The time complexity of the solution is O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the input linked lists. This is because we iterate through both lists once to perform the addition.

**What is the space complexity of the solution?** <br />
The space complexity of the solution is O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the input linked lists. This is because we create a new linked list to store the output, and the length of the output can be at most max(m, n) + 1.

**Can the input linked lists be modified?** <br />
No, the input linked lists cannot be modified. We are to create a new linked list to store the output.

**What happens if the lengths of the input linked lists are not the same?** <br />
If the lengths of the input linked lists are not the same, we can assume that the shorter list has 0's padded at the end to make it the same length as the longer list.
